there are test issues of: 
Github name: Kercho0 
Github Link: https://github.com/Kercho0/601-P2

In general, the Twitter API is complete. Contain calls to the Twitter API.

There are some minor problems or suggestion:
1:There is no problem with code calling the Twitter API directly.
  However, from a testing point of view, whether we need to do a filter or statistics on the output content.  
  For example, the content we call will appear in Japanese or non-English words.  Or the content of the output is repeated.
2:The code does not contain some annotations. So it is not unfriendly to read.
3:The GitHub file is a little mess. It is a recommendation that placeing each assignment clearly in a folder. This will make it easier to find later.

The author's overall code is correct and good.The above small questions are only suggestions from the perspective of product testing.
Thank you very much ！
